Some gems should be "frozen" (ie placed in vendor/gems).
Rails will give precedence to these gems over system gems.

When should a gem be frozen and included in the crabgrass
distribution? Use this as a guide:

(1) if crabgrass is sensitive to the gem version, it might
    be a good idea to freeze it to make installation easier.

(2) if the gem is really small, why not freeze it? If it is
    large, please don't freeze it.

(3) gems which are architecture dependent (ie they are
    compiled) should not be frozen.

(4) if a gem is really uncommon, and there is unlikely to be
    a package for it, then consider freezing it.

To freeze a gem named 'x':

  edit environment.rb:
    config.gem 'x'
  run:
    rake gems:unpack GEM=x

If you freeze a gem, please document what the gem is used
for here:

greencloth
---------------------

This is the wiki text markup language used by crabgrass. It
is based on RedCloth, with some modifications to make it
work better with wikis.

uglify_html
---------------------

Some WYSIWYG text editors don't handle nice HTML very well. 
This gem will take beautiful HTML and transform it into the
ugly version needed by these editors. 

TODO: is this used anymore? isn't this only for nicEdit?
I think this is currently unused.

undress
---------------------

Converts HTML to Textile markup. This is used in order to be
able to switch back and forth between a WYSIWYG editor and a
plain text editor.

compass
---------------------

Extensions to SASS that adds some utility functions and a
bunch of SASS mixins in order to support a wide variety of
CSS frameworks, including the one used by Crabgrass (Susy).

compass susy plugin
---------------------

An Extension to compass that adds support for the Susy CSS
framework.
