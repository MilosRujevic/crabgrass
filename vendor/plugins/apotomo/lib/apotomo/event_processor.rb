#require 'singleton'

module Apotomo
  # Implements a pipeline for EventHandlers to be executed.
  # Discussion is needed here.
  # - should an EventHandler be executed right in time when it is queued?
  #   or should we rather wait until the current rendering cycle finishes?
  #   or introduce a method to stop rendering right after firing in the state method?
  # - should we delete contents that are <= newer contents? they are outdated, though.
  # - should we stop an invoke cycle if a new event is fired which has an EventHandler
  #   that is >= the firing widget. After more thinking, i came to the conclusion this is
  #   too complicated and should put the user's responsibility.
  
  # see acts_as_widget.txt for discussion of the queue pattern.
