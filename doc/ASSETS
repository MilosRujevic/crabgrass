ASSETS
========================================

image thumbnails
----------------

For image thumbnails you need the following

apt-get install graphicsmagick
gem install mime-types --no-ri --no-rdoc

document previews
------------------

To build image thumbnails of office documents, install:

/--
apt-get install graphicsmagick openoffice.org openoffice.org-headless msttcorefonts
gem install mime-types --no-ri --no-rdoc
\--

Graphicsmagick is needed for building thumbnails. OfficeOffice is needed for
previewing Microsoft Office and OpenOffice documents. The mime-types gem is use
to overcome a file uploading bug in ie6. OpenOffice should be at least version
2.4 or greater. If you are running etch, you can install the backport
of openoffice:

/--
apt-get -t etch-backports install openoffice.org openoffice.org-headless
\--

audio encoding
--------------

Embedded flash players can only play mp3 and mp4 audio. Unfortuntely, the ffmpeg
that is packaged for debian and ubuntu won't convert audio files to these formats.

ffmpeg, however, normally can convert to these formats, using all GPL code.
You 'just' have to download the latest source and build ffmpeg yourself:

For ubuntu gutsy:
/--
sudo apt-get install liba52-dev libdts-dev libgsm1-dev libvorbis-dev libxvidcore4 libxvidcore-dev libdc1394-dev libfaac-dev liblame-dev libx264-dev libfaad-dev libtheora-dev libsdl1.2-dev 
wget http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg-export-snapshot.tar.bz2
tar jxvf ffmpeg-export-snapshot.tar.bz2
cd ffmpeg-export-*
./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-debug --enable-shared --enable-gpl --enable-postproc --enable-swscale --enable-pthreads --enable-x11grab --enable-liba52 --enable-libdc1394 --enable-libfaac --enable-libfaad --enable-libgsm --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libtheora --enable-libvorbis --enable-libxvid
make
sudo checkinstall
\--

The problem with building ffmpeg, of course, is that it relies on a ton of
libraries and the package names are always changing. Good luck.

SVG previews
---------------

# apt-get install inkscape

Creating a new preview processor
--------------------------------

(1) Create a new Processor subclass in lib/media/process
(2) Modify lib/media/process.rb to configure what mime-types the
    processor can read and generate
    You MUST modify at least these:
    PRIORITY, CONTENT_TYPES_CONSUMED_BY, CONTENT_TYPES_PRODUCED_BY
(3) Modify config/initializers/assets.rb to define the constant
    for what executable is used in your processor.

ocropus + Tesseract
---------------------

I had an idea to do OCR on pdfs, for sight-impaired users, but it is a bigger project than
expected.  Here are the notes on installing the pieces which will probably be needed.  This
will also permit full text seaching of pdfs.

/-- Installing Tesseract
# from http://sites.google.com/site/ocropus/install-02
# Use of pre-packaged versions of Tesseract (e.g. Debian or Ubuntu tesseract-dev package) is not supported right now

svn co http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tesseract-ocr
cd tesseract-ocr
./configure    # CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -O2" ./configure if you want Python later
make
sudo make install                                # installs in /usr/local
\--

/-- Installing required packages to build ocropus
sudo apt-get install ftjam libpng12-dev libjpeg62-dev libtiff4-dev
\--

/-- Installing ocropus
# from http://sites.google.com/site/ocropus/install
wget http://ocropus.googlecode.com/files/ocropus-0.2.tar.gz
tar xvfz ocropus-0.2.tar.gz
./configure    # CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -O2" ./configure if you want Python later
jam             # do not use boost jam!
sudo jam install 
\--

The issue now is that there is not a single command which makes ocropus eat a pdf
file.  I think the approach will have to be covert the pdf to pngs, and have ocropus eat
the pngs.  Not too hard, but not something I'm up for today.
