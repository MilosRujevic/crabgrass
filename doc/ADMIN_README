CRABGRASS ADMINISTRATION
========================================================

Via the console
----------------

One goal in Crabgrass system design is to avoid creating different levels of
privilege for users.  Shall this be an egalitarian social network, or shall we
build another anarchist bureaucracy? But what about when people need a new
password, etc? 

Example:  RESETING A PASSWORD

/--
$ script/console production
>> u = User.find_for_forget("user's email")
>> u.password = u.password_confirmation = "new password"
>> u.save
\--

Via super_admin mod
-------------------

There is a mod that is disabled by default that gives certain users
a super admin interface. 

(1) Edit config/sites.yml to add which users should be super admins
(2) Edit config/mods_enabled.list to enable super_admin module
(3) Edit config/routes.rb and uncomment the super_admin routes
(4) restart rails, login, and browse to /admin
