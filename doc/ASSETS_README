========================================

For image thumbnails and document previews, you need the following

/--
apt-get install graphicsmagick openoffice.org openoffice.org-headless msttcorefonts
gem install mime-types --no-ri --no-rdoc
\--

Graphicsmagick is needed for building thumbnails. OfficeOffice is needed for
previewing Microsoft Office and OpenOffice documents. The mime-types gem is use
to overcome a file uploading bug in ie6. OpenOffice should be at least version
2.4 or greater. If you are running etch, you can install the backport
of openoffice:

/--
apt-get -t etch-backports install openoffice.org openoffice.org-headless
\--


ocropus + Tesseract

I had an idea to do OCR on pdfs, for sight-impaired users, but it is a bigger project than
expected.  Here are the notes on installing the pieces which will probably be needed.  This
will also permit full text seaching of pdfs.

/-- Installing Tesseract
# from http://sites.google.com/site/ocropus/install-02
# Use of pre-packaged versions of Tesseract (e.g. Debian or Ubuntu tesseract-dev package) is not supported right now

svn co http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tesseract-ocr
cd tesseract-ocr
./configure    # CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -O2" ./configure if you want Python later
make
sudo make install                                # installs in /usr/local
\--

/-- Installing required packages to build ocropus
sudo apt-get install ftjam libpng12-dev libjpeg62-dev libtiff4-dev
\--

/-- Installing ocropus
# from http://sites.google.com/site/ocropus/install
wget http://ocropus.googlecode.com/files/ocropus-0.2.tar.gz
tar xvfz ocropus-0.2.tar.gz
./configure    # CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -O2" ./configure if you want Python later
jam             # do not use boost jam!
sudo jam install 
\--

The issue now is that there is not a single command which makes ocropus eat a pdf
file.  I think the approach will have to be covert the pdf to pngs, and have ocropus eat
the pngs.  Not too hard, but not something I'm up for today.
