= Installing Sphinx Search Engine

Sphinx is a reverse index that runs in the background and handles full text
searches. 

Without sphinx installed and the sphinx search daemon running, full text searches
will not work and searching will fall back to dumb mysql searches.

check http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html for the latest version

  sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient15-dev build-essential
  wget http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads/sphinx-xxxxxx.tar.gz
  tar xzvf sphinx-xxxxxx.tar.gz
  cd sphinx-xxxxxxx
  ./configure -sysconfdir=/etc
  make
  sudo make install

Instead of <tt>sudo make install</tt> you can try <tt>sudo checkinstall</tt> to install as
a debian package.

= Configuring Sphinx

Edit <tt>config/sphinx.yml</tt> to change any options you need to. 

To test to see if sphinx is installed and working, you can try to build the
config file. Generally, this is done for you, but it is good for testing:

  rake ts:config RAILS_ENV=production

If you don't get any errors, then things are probably working.

= Sphinx In Development Mode

  cd ~/development/crabgrass
  rake cg:update_page_terms
  rake ts:index
  rake ts:start

= Sphinx in Production Mode

Mostly, to do the same steps to start out:

  rake ts:config RAILS_ENV=production
  rake ts:index RAILS_ENV=production
  rake ts:start RAILS_ENV=production

Crabgrass uses delta indexes. This makes it faster to get new changes in the database,
but only so long as the delta index is small. So, you need to clear out the delta index
by reindexing all the records on a regular basis:

Set up a cron job to do this nightly:

  cd /usr/apps/crabgrass/current && rake ts:index RAILS_ENV=production

NOTE: this should be done automatically for you if you have backgroundrb working.
