= Running Crabgrass In Production Mode

== Setup Database

For installing on a production server, most everything is the same
as a {development setup}[link:files/doc/INSTALL.html] except for the following differences.

For development work, there is not much need to create a database user for
crabgrass. For deployment, however, this is a typical permissions setup:

  GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'crabgrass'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'xxxx';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON crabgrass.* TO 'crabgrass'@'localhost';
  flush privileges;

Edit config/database.yml accordingly. 

To create the production database is the same as for development, except
that we don't want to load the test fixture data:

  cd ~/production/crabgrass
  rake db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=production
  rake cg:load_default_data RAILS_ENV=production

== Configure Your System 

There are several required configuration files:

* config/database.yml
* config/sites.yml
* config/email.yml
* config/environments/production.rb

If you are not running over https only, then you must comment out this line in
production.rb:

  Crabgrass::Config.https_only = true

It is important that you specify your own secret in the sites.yml file. 
You can use the command <tt>rake secret</tt> to generate a secret value. 

== Running Background Tasks

There are many tasks which crabgrass needs to run regularly in the background,
including cleaning out cache files and recreating the sphinx index.

These tasks will be run if you have backgroundrb running. You can configure the
frequency of these tasks by editing config/backgroundrb.yml.

First, install the backgroundrb requirements:

  sudo gem install chronic packet --no-ri --no-rdoc

Start backgroundrb:

  script/backgroundrb start -e production

== Running The Sphinx Search Deamon

Sphinx must be running when crabgrass is started for it to be used. If sphinx
searchd daemon is not detected, then crabgrass will not use fulltext searching.

First make sure that you have an up to date sphinx database:

  rake ts:index RAILS_ENV=production

Then to start sphinx, run this:

  rake ts:start RAILS_ENV=production

For installation instructions and further details, see SPHINX[link:files/doc/SPHINX.html]

== Other Tips

You can run analysis on the logs using pl_analyze if the 'SyslogLogger'
gem is installed.

There is an example capistrano deploy.rb in the config directory.
