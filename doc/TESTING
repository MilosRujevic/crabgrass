= Testing Crabgrass

TODO: this needs a lot of help.

== Testings Mods

A great deal of the crabgrass code is in the form of engines-enhanced
and crabgrass-specific plugins. See mods/README and tools/README for
more information. To run the tests for these special plugins:

  rake test:tools
  rake test:mods

To run the test for a particular tool or mod:

  rake test:tools TOOL=gallery_tool
  rake test:mods MOD=gibberize
