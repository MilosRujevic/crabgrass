= Testing Crabgrass

TODO: this needs a lot of help.

== Testings Mods

A great deal of the crabgrass code is in the form of engines-enhanced
and crabgrass-specific plugins. See docs/MODS and docs/TOOLS for
more information. To run the tests for these special plugins:

  rake test:tools:all
  rake test:mods:all

You can replace 'all' with 'units' or 'functionals'. 

To run the test for a particular tool or mod:

  rake test:tools:all TOOL=gallery_tool
  rake test:mods:all MOD=gibberize

== Tests and Sites

When running tests, the request host is 'test.host'. There is a site with this domain setup in the fixtures. Normally, it is not enabled. 

Those tests that would like to test sites can call Conf.enable_site_testing()
in setup().
