= Testing Crabgrass

TODO: this needs a lot of help.

== Testings Mods

A great deal of the crabgrass code is in the form of engines-enhanced
and crabgrass-specific plugins. See docs/MODS and docs/TOOLS for
more information. To run the tests for these special plugins:

  rake test:tools:all
  rake test:mods:all

You can replace 'all' with 'units' or 'functionals'. 

To run the test for a particular tool or mod:

  rake test:tools:all TOOL=gallery_tool
  rake test:mods:all MOD=gibberize

== Tests and Sites

When running tests, the request host is 'test.host'. There is a site with this domain setup in the fixtures. Normally, it is not enabled. 

Those tests that would like to test sites can call Conf.enable_site_testing()
in setup().

== Adding a new page fixture

In pages.yml copy and paste an existing page fixture. Give it a unique name and id. Set the 'data_type' and 'data_id' to point to your data model. For example 'Wiki' and 1 for a new wiki page. Set created_by and update_by fields.

For examples sake, say you created a new page with these parameters (some stuff omitted):

my_wiki_page:
  id: 240
  title: my wiki
  type: WikiPage
  data_type: Wiki
  data_id: 2
  created_by_id: 1
  created_by_login: quentin
  updated_by_id: 3
  updated_by_login: gerrard


Edit user_participation.yml to setup correct permissions. Check the existing entries for the most up to date reference, but what you need is one entry for each user who should be allowed to edit you page. Each entry looks like this.

my_wiki_page_blue:
  id: <%= id+=1 %>
  page_id: 240
  user_id: 4
  access: 1

It should have a name like 'page_name' + _ + 'user_name' and the correct user_id field. Access can be 1 in most cases. Available options are
  admin: 1
  edit:  2
  view:  3
  none:  4

See config/initializers/00-constants.rb for reference.

Finally, after creating new user_participation fields. You must run these commands:

rake db:fixtures:load
rake cg:update_page_terms
rake cg:update_fixtures


They will update page_terms.yml fixtures, which is what is actually used for resolving permissions.
