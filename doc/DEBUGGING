= Some tips for debugging in crabgrass

== General Testing Tips

You can run a single test at a time like so:

  ruby test/unit/user_test.rb --name test_user_name

== Using INFO environment variable

sometimes, it is much more useful to use print for debugging than
to step through with a debugger.

to enable the printing of the 'info()' messages, define the INFO
environment variable:

  INFO=1 ruby test/unit/user_test.rb

  INFO=0 rake test:units

  INFO=3 script/server

The info level determines how much is shown:

  0 -- only high level stuff
  1 -- more detail
  2 -- even more detail
       and so on...
 
== Stopping on a SQL query

have you ever wanted to know what part of your code was triggering a particular
sql query? set the STOP_ON_SQL environment variable to find out.

For example:

  export STOP_ON_SQL='SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE (`users`.`id` = 633)'
  script/server -u

This will drop you into the debugger whenever that query occurs.
