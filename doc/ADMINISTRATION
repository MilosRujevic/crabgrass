= Crabgrass Administration

One goal in Crabgrass system design is to avoid creating different levels of
privilege for users.  Shall this be an egalitarian social network, or shall we
build another anarchist bureaucracy? But what about when people need a new
password, etc? 

== Example: Resetting a password via the console

  $ script/console production
  >> u = User.find_for_forget("user's email")
  >> u.password = u.password_confirmation = "new password"
  >> u.save

== Using super_admin mod

There is a mod that is disabled by default that gives certain users
a super admin interface. 

1. Edit config/sites.yml to set which group should be super admins
2. Edit config/mods_enabled.list to enable super_admin module
3. restart rails, login, and browse to /admin
