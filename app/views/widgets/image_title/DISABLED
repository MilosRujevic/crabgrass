i think the image title widget should be removed until its improved. You should be able to add their own image, or select from a choice. right now its odd to me to have this big kinda elementary school icon that is very specifics as the only option. It does not match design wise or layout wise the rest of sitehome and attracts to much attention, wreaking the visual hierarchy. i think it detracts and would be better left out till its improved.
