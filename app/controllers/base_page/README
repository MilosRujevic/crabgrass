The naming scheme for page controllers has evolved higgildy piggildy over time.

So, this should be cleaned up. For now, this is what it is like:


pages_controller -- doesn't do much of anything.

base_page_controller -- all the page subclasses derive from this.

base_page/sidebar_controller -- all the sidebar page controllers derive from this

The sidebar/popups controllers
  base_page/assets_controller -- for attachments
  base_page/participation_controller -- things relating to page <> user
  base_page/share_controller -- for notify/share
  base_page/tags_controller -- for editing tags
  base_page/title_controller -- for editing the title
  base_page/trash_controller -- for deleting
  base_page/sidebar_controller -- not sure if this is actually used
