DEVELOPMENT NOTES
=====================================

There appears to be a bug in susy if you specify different gutter and side-gutter values. It may be a problem with the susy webkit hack, or it may be a general susy problem.


USEFUL COMMANDS
=====================================

re regenerate the debug grid:
  cd public
  ../vendor/gems/compass-0.10.4/bin/compass grid-img 40+15 --force

SUSY CRASH COURSE
=========================================

grid element
  an html element that has been asigned a spanning width on the susy grid.
  this is done with the 'columns' or 'full' mixins.

non-grid element
  all the other html elements

container
  an element that @includes 'container'.
  the thing that encloses everybody else.

root context
  an element with a 'container' as its closest grid ancestor 
  side gutters are taken into account only in the root context.

nested context
  any element that is not in a root context. in other words, its nearest grid
  ancestor is not a 'container'

mixins:

  The `columns` mixin:
     @include columns($span, [$context]);

  The `full` mixin:
     @include full([$context]);

  Note: $context is a column number.
        It must not NOT be passed at the root level.
        It MUST be passed at nested levels.

  alpha
    to declare elements which include the first column within their parent element
    (only matters for root context, and when not using full column)
    @include alpha

  omega
    to declare elements which include the last column within their parent element
    (only matters for root context, and when not using full column)
    @include omega

  padding
    The `prefix`, `suffix` and `pad` mixins add column paddings to the left,
    right, or both sides of a column:
       @include prefix($prefix-span [, $context])
       @include prefix($suffix-span [, $context])
       @include pad($prefix-span, $suffix-span [, $context])

NOTES
============================================

From the html5 spec:

  "The section element represents a generic section of a document or
   application. A section, in this context, is a thematic GROUPING OF
   CONTENT, typically with a heading"
   http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-section-element
   (emphasis added)

This could be read a few different ways. Some on the web focus on the first 
"generic section" part, others focus on the "content" part. I choose to read
this to mean that sections are to be used for grouping content, not
as a generic container element.


UNRESOLVED
============================================

The masthead tabs get messed up when you make the window really small. Can we make it not wrap?
