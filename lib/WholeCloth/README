WholeCloth
==========
WholeCloth is derived from RedCloth, the defacto text to html converter for ruby.

Deployment
----------
You need to compile RedCloth, as it is written in C. 
/--
cd WholeCloth/RedCloth
rake compile
\--

Development
-----------
To run the all the tests:
/--
ruby run-tests.rb
\--
or a specific set of tests:
/--
ruby run-tests.rb tests/basic.yml
\--

RedCloth is built on Ragel, a state machine language for C. As such, you have to compile it. To do so, go into the RedCloth subdirectory and run:
/--
rake compile
\--

Changes from RedCloth
-------------------
These syntax changes were made by modifying RedCloth/ext/redcloth_scan/redcloth_inline.rl:
* Disabled redcloth style links e.g. "google":google.com
* require spaces for @ code tags, e.g. @ blah blah @ instead of @blah blah@
Changes made in redcloth_scan.rl:
* Disabled 'link aliases'

These syntax changes were made in wholecloth.rb:
* Crabgrass style links [google -> google.com]
* Autolinks
* Crabgrass style code blocks, like in this document
* Markdown blockquotes
* Setext headers

Also some html elements were added to the whitelist in RedCloth/lib/redcloth/formatters/html.rb
