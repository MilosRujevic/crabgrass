GreenCloth is derived from RedCloth, the defacto text to html converter for ruby.

GreenCloth requires that RedCloth version > 4.0 is installed and that prior
versions are NOT installed.

== Testing

To run the all the tests:

  rake test

Or to test the markup from a specific fixture:

  ruby test/markup_test.rb test/fixtures/images.yml


== Changes from RedCloth

New markup:

* Crabgrass style links [my blog post -> meblogpretty.org/2008/4/5]
* Autolinks
* Crabgrass style code blocks
* Markdown blockquotes
* Setext headers (h1 is formed by under line with ====, h2 underline with ----)
* Allow embedded video tags, and sanitize these embeds. 
* Tables can use tabs in addition to pipes (|)
* Insert table of contents with [[toc]]

== TODO

greencloth does work with RedCloth 4.1.9
the last known working version is 4.1.1
