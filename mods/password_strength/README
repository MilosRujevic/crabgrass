This is the mod to do client-side password strength verification using javascript.

This code has been superseded by the more accurate ajax server-based password
strength test using cracklib, contained in the mod 'cracklib'

The advantage to this client-side code over the cracklib code is that:

(1) it does not require cracklib
(2) it is very fast, since it is entirely client side.
    (although there is also a server-side validation component as well)

The advantage of cracklib:

(1) it can use the full cracklib dictionaries
(2) it is a more accurate assessment of a password's strength, where as the
    client-side code is just a rough guess.
