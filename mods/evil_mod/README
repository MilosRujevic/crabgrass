evil_mod
========

This is the evil_mod for crabgrass. It allows you to integrate Google 
Analytics into your application, and maybe other evil things in the future.

Configuration
=============

Open up config/sites.yml and look for the evil: key. Turn 'enabled' to true,
set the site id, and configure if you would like the google code to be
requested over https or not.

Also don't forget to enable the module in config/mods_enabled.list.
