This mod will enforce good passwords using cracklib. 

It uses ajax to connect to the server and test the password as the user types it.

For this to work, cracklib runtime must be installed (in particular, the executable 'cracklib-check' must be in the path).

On debian:

  sudo aptitude install cracklib-runtime

Also, you should install some dictionaries. These can then be converted into
cracklib wordlists by running update-cracklib.

  sudo aptitude install wamerican wbrazilian wspanish wgerman wfrench
  sudo update-cracklib

TODO: use the gem rubycracklib instead, if it installed.
