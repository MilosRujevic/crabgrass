CRABGRASS
=========================================================

Crabgrass is a software libre web application designed for group and network

ADMINISTRATION
=========================================================

One goal in Crabgrass system design is to avoid creating
different levels of privilege for users.  Shall this be
an egalitarian social network, or shall we build another
anarchist bureaucracy?  But what about when people need
a new password, etc?  For now, this administrative stuff
can be done from the rails console.

Example:  RESETING A PASSWORD
$ script/console production
>> u = User.find_for_forget("user's email")
>> u.password = u.password_confirmation = "new password"
>> u.save
