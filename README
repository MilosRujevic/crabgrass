CRABGRASS
========================================================

Crabgrass is a software libre web application designed for group and network
organizing, and tailored to the needs of the global justice movement. The long
term goal is to provide the technical tools to facilitate active, confederal,
and directly democratic social change networks.

INSTALL FOR DEVELOPMENT
========================================================

grab the code
--------------

To get a copy of the most recent code:

/--
cd ~/development
git clone git://labs.riseup.net/crabgrass.git
\--

See https://labs.riseup.net/code for information on releases.

install the requirements
------------------------

These packages are required:

/--
apt-get install ruby1.8 ruby1.8-dev libmysql-ruby rubygems rake
gem install -y rails --no-ri --no-rdoc
gem install RedCloth -v 3.0.4 --no-ri --no-rdoc
gem install rmagick tzinfo --no-ri --no-rdoc
\--

These packages are optional, but necessary for image thumbnails
and document previews:

/--
apt-get install graphicsmagick openoffice.org openoffice.org-headless msttcorefonts
gem install mime-types --no-ri --no-rdoc
\--

Graphicsmagick is needed for building thumbnails. OfficeOffice is needed for
previewing Microsoft Office and OpenOffice documents. The mime-types gem is use
to overcome a file uploading bug in ie6. OpenOffice should be at least version
2.4 or greater. If you are running etch, you can install the backport
of openoffice:

/--
apt-get -t etch-backports install openoffice.org openoffice.org-headless
\--
For more details, see docs/ASSETS_README.


To use full-text searching, you need to build and install sphinx search http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html (debian package coming soon).  For more details, see doc/SPHINX_README.

For search to do asynchronous index generation, you need BackgrounDRb to work,
which requires the chronic and packet gems:
@@ sudo gem install chronic packet 
and then should start the backgroundrb daemon
@@ script/backgroundrb start

These packages are need for running tests:

/--
gem install ruby-debug hpricot --no-ri --no-rdoc
\--

If you want to be able to include latex markup in wiki pages:

/--
apt-get install graphicsmagick texlive gs-gpl
gem install open4 --no-ri --no-rdoc
\--

setup mysql database
--------------------

Crabgrass only works with mysql (although most tests may be run from sqlite).

Install mysql and create the databases:

/--
apt-get install mysql-server
mysqladmin -u root -p create crabgrass create crabgrass_development create crabgrass_test
\--

There is a sample database configuration file in the 'config' directory of the
crabgrass application. Use that to create a config/database.yml file. For some
linux distributions, you may need to specify a socket file for mysql like so:
"socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock". You can probably figure out what socket
to use by running "ps -ef | grep mysql".

The final step is to load the crabgrass schema and populate it with test data:

/--
cd ~/development/crabgrass
rake db:schema:load
rake db:fixtures:load
rake cg:load_default_data
\--

To upgrade the crabgrass database after pulling in new code:

/--
cd ~/development/crabgrass
git pull
rake db:migrate
rake db:fixtures:load
rake cg:load_default_data
\--

Also, 'rake --version' must be 8.1 or greater.

run crabgrass
-------------

/--
cd ~/development/crabgrass
script/server
\--

This will run crabgrass in development mode, which is probably what you want. If
you donâ€™t want to use webbrick (the mini-web-server that comes with rails) you
can install the mongrel gem or debian package. If installed, script/server will
pick them instead.

Once the server is running, just point your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

INSTALL FOR PRODUCTION
========================================================

For installing on a production server, most everything is the same
as a development setup except for these differences.

For development work, there is not much need to create a database user for
crabgrass. For deployment, however, this is a typical permissions setup:

/--
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'crabgrass'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'xxxx';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON crabgrass.* TO 'crabgrass'@'localhost';
flush privileges;
\--

Edit config/database.yml accordingly. 

To create the production database is the same as for development, except
that we don't want to load the test fixture data:

/--
cd ~/development/crabgrass
rake db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=production
rake cg:load_default_data RAILS_ENV=production
\--

You can run analysis on the logs using pl_analyze if the 'SyslogLogger'
gem is installed.

There is an example capistrano deploy.rb in the config directory.

To run in production mode:

/--
export RAILS_ENV=production
script/server
\--

clean out cached files
-----------------------

By default, crabgrass will store fragment caches in tmp/cache when running in
production mode. These cache files are not expired automatically, but old cache
files can be safely deleted... should be!

It is probably a good idea to run this once in a while:

  tmpreaper 7d /usr/apps/crabgrass/tmp/cache

On debian, the package name is 'tmpreaper'

TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================================

If you get:

/--
extconf.rb:11:in `require': no such file to load -- mkmf (LoadError)
\--

...then you need also to install ruby1.8-dev.
