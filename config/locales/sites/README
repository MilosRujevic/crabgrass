Each site has it's own folder here. That folder multiple yml files, one file per language.

I18n module will look in here first for a translation key and if nothing is found, it will default to locales/lang.yml file.

Example structure:


config/
  locales/
    en.yml
    es.yml
    sites/
      examplesitedomain.org/
        en.yml
        es.yml
