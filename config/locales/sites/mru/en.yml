      *Greetings. Welcome to the MRU Youth Platform!*
      
      This is your platform! Use it wisely, and remember you are responsible
      for everything you post. You will have semi-privacy within your groups.
      No other user will be able to see the information in your group, unless
      you choose to share it. However, this site has heavy moderation and
      moderators can see all content on the site. So, keep in mind that the
      content of discussions must remain appropriate.
      
      We hope that you find the platform easy to use, and a productive place
      to discuss issues around employment, youth-led develpment and
      empowerment.

      MRU Youth Network contains all youth from the MRU countries: Cote dâ€™Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
      The MRU Youth Network provides users with a great opportunity to network with other youth from the sub-region, share ideas, provide peer-to-peer support, and gather relevant information.
      This network also contains links to youth employment opportunities in the Mano River Union countries, as well as relevant documentation on youth employment.
