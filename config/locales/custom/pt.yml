N\xC3\xB3s n\xC3\xA3o devemos ser for\xC3\xA7ados a confiar em formas de comunica\xC3\xA7\xC3\xA3o inseguras, voltadas ao lucro, que bombardeiam nossa mente com incont\xC3\xA1veis propagandas e an\xC3\xBAncios.\r\n\
  \r\n\
  Riseup.net acredita na democracia direta, anti-sexismo, anti-racismo, anti-capitalismo, auto determina\xC3\xA7\xC3\xA3o, autonomia local, ecologia e economia comunit\xC3\xA1ria.

Pedimos para que voc\xC3\xAA n\xC3\xA3o use os servi\xC3\xA7os riseup.net para advogar algum dos seguintes:\r\n\
  \r\n\
  * Suporte ao capitalismo, domina\xC3\xA7\xC3\xA3o ou hierarquia.\r\n\

  * Estrat\xC3\xA9gias de vanguardas para revolu\xC3\xA7\xC3\xA3o.\r\n\
  * Controle populacional.\r\n\
