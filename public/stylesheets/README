How do stylesheets work?

First and foremost, you need to know that some of the .css files are
automatically generated and should not be edited by hand.

Files in stylesheets/sass/*.sass are automatically converted into .css files and
placed in stylesheets/*.css. 

To read more about the format of .sass files, see:

  http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/rdoc/classes/Sass.html

There are three main categories of css files:

core:
  the core stylesheets that are included in all pages.

as_needed:
  stylesheets that are only sometimes used. for example, stylesheets
  for a particular tool.

ie:
  stylesheets for ie6 and ie7 hacks.

holygrail:
  holygrail is the layout template that crabgrass uses. the pure,
  unaltered holygrail stylesheets live here.

'core' and 'as_needed' stylesheets are generated by overloading Sass constants
with CustomAppearance user specified parameters (see sass/README)
the resulting css is dropped in stylesheets/themes/'id'/'timestamp' directory
'id' and 'timestamp' are unique for each CustomAppearance

core stylesheets
-----------------

These are loaded in this order:

reset.css:
  css reset to help deal with browser differences.

layout.css
  this file is for modifications to the default holygrail css.

design.css:
  general 'shell' css, fonts, and a catch-all for everything not in one of
  the other files.

landing.css:
  css related specifically to the dashboard, the group home, and the
  person profile. 

page.css:
  everything specific to content pages (ie wiki, discussion, gallery, etc).

ui_elements.css:
  common reusable css elements that are used everywhere.

wiki.css:
  formatting for the html that is generated from wiki markup by greencloth.

images.css:
  anything related to the display of images should go here.
  this includes icons, thumbnails, avatars.
