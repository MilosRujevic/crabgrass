How do stylesheets work?

First and foremost, you need to know that some of the .css files are
automitically generated and should not be edited by hand.

There are three main categories of css files:

* core
* as_needed
* ie
* holygrail


core stylesheets
-----------------

These are loaded in this order:

reset.css:
  css reset to help deal with browser differences.

layout.css
  this file is for modifications to the default holygrail css.

design.css:
  general 'shell' css, fonts, and a catch-all for everything not in one of
  the other files.

landing.css:
  css related specifically to the dashboard, the group home, and the
  person profile. 

page.css:
  everything specific to content pages (ie wiki, discussion, gallery, etc).

ui_elements.css:
  common reusable css elements that are used everywhere.

wiki.css:
  formatting for the html that is generated from wiki markup by greencloth.

images.css:
  anything related to the display of images should go here.
  this includes icons, thumbnails, avatars.
