DO NOT INCLUDE '@import constants.sass' IN ANY SASS FILES

doing that will break the custom appearances system, which loads and overrides this file manually

What is the custom appearances system?
1. a model which stores the overrides for some values found in constants.sass
2. a controller which catches .css requests (like '/stylesheets/as_needed/wiki.css') and drives the Sass engine to generate the requested css dynamically (by overriding some part of constants.sass)
3. A caching scheme for #2. Generated css is cached to '/stylesheets/themes' and layout_helper links to the cached css when it is available and up to date (based on timestamps)


As it is now, the current domain (and so the current site) determines which CustomAppearance object is used to generate/cache/load the css.
